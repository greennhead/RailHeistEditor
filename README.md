## A Level Editor for UFO 50's Rail Heist. 
### Made in Godot 4.4
It can generate code that you can put in your rail heist mod, or alternatively you can save a json and use it with the rail heist level loader mod.

I in no way own UFO 50 or any of these assets.

## Controls:
- WASD - Navigation
- Shift (hold) - Faster navigation
- Mouse
- Plus - Zoom in
- Minus - Zoom out

## Known jank/bugs:
- Moving your mouse too fast will create gaps in tiles
- Some objects are in wrong places ingame (if found, please report which ones and how far off they are)
- 

## Credits:
- Mossmouth - UFO 50
- Phil - Rail Heist tile sheet
